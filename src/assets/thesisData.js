      "In a Priory Varsity Hockey game against Ladue on November 22nd, 2024, Freddy Gaertner '26 handles the puck through the Ladue defense. That is until he was tripped by a Ladue player who is out of frame. Even after being tripped, seemingly floating in the air, still has his eyes focused on moving forward. To capture this shot, I made sure my camera was shooting at a high shutter speed to freeze the action, specifically, it was at 1/800s!",
      "Quite possibly one of my favorite photos that I have ever taken depicts Nate Sutto '26, a goalie, has his eyes locked on to the falling puck in a puck-drop between Priory's number 76, JP Nadero '25, and Clayton's number 12. This picture was taken back on November 11, 2023, and even though I didn't study sports photography as I do now, I was able to capture one of the best shots of the year. What makes this picture so great from a technical perspective is most importantly the framing of the image. To make this picture great, I made sure that Nate was positioned in the middle of the frame (though the rule of thirds was not followed, I believe that it should be except in this particular photo) and in the foreground, blurred, are the two players going head to head.",
      "In a thriller of a game on February 24, 2024, the Priory Varsity Basketball team ended up winning their first district championship since 1956! In this game, the amount of determination, comradery, and pure grit was put on display. In this picture is one of the pivotal players on the team Robby Temprano '26, who was one of the point leaders on the team during this historic season, dribbles down the court while a Whitfield player is determined to stop him. While I wouldn't consider this picture great, I would consider it good. The good comes from the facial expressions that I have captured in this frame; however, this picture loses some points in my book because the right hand of the Whitfield player has been cut out of frame. In sports photography, you want to ensure that all limbs are in the picture.",

      "To me, a great shot that embodies determination in sports photography requires a diverse set of skills. Capturing an athlete's pure grit and perseverance involves getting up close to the action while remaining off the field, rink, or court. For this, I rely on my Sigma 60-600mm lens, which offers outstanding versatility in sports photography. This lens allows me to capture incredibly detailed close-up shots, showcasing the intensity and passion in an athlete's expression, while also giving me the ability to zoom out sufficiently to encompass the broader scene and all of the unfolding action. \n In this section, you will find a selection of some of my favorite photographs featuring Priory athletes, each highlighting their unwavering determination to win. These images encapsulate the moments that truly define dedication and hard work in sports. To dive deeper into the story behind each smaller image, simply click on the image itself for annotations and insights on what makes each shot unique and meaningful. I hope you enjoy viewing these moments as much as I enjoyed capturing them!",

      "This photograph almost perfectly captures the essence of excitement in sports. Taken on November 25, 2024, during a Priory Varsity Hockey game against Fort Zumwalt West, Freddy Gaertner '26 leaps into the glass in celebration after scoring a pivotal goal. Surrounding him, Priory fans erupt in cheers, their energy and passion mirroring Gaertner's joy. To the left, teammate Auggie Werner '27 skates in, celebrating alongside him and adding a layer of camaraderie to the image. What makes this photo remarkable to me is the raw emotion from both the players and the most noticeable, the crowd. I ensured my camera settings were optimized to capture the high-intensity action‚Äîusing a fast shutter speed of 1/800s to freeze Gaertner mid-air and highlight the dynamic interaction between the athlete and his ecstatic supporters.",
      "This shot captures Wynn O'Keefe '25 celebrating one of his first-ever varsity hockey goals in a game against Northwest on January 11, 2024. The mere excitement on Wynn‚Äôs face, with his glove raised high in victory, says it all. To his right, teammates Jack Lerits '25, Jake Waltz '25, and Cameron Robinson '25 stand near celebrating with him, their smiles beaming with pride and energy. What makes this picture stand out to me is the moment's purity‚ÄîWynn‚Äôs joy, supported by his teammates, tells a story of hard work and achievement. I used a fast shutter speed of 1/800s to ensure the players were sharply captured, freezing this perfect moment of celebration. The composition draws attention to Wynn as the focal point, but the inclusion of his teammates and the opposing goalie adds depth to the image, balancing the emotion on both sides of the play.",
      "Under the Friday night lights of September 8, 2023, Jack Parent '25 celebrates in pure adrenaline after scoring on a quarterback keeper in a game against Lutheran South. Front and center in the picture, Jack screams with raw emotion, flexing his forearms confidence, strength, and energy. The brighter backdrop of the night game makes the moment feel larger than life, with Jack acting as a silhouette.",

      "Quite possibly one of my favorite categories to get a picture of is excitement. Immediately after checking my camera once an exciting moment happens in a game, I am very quickly able to tell if it will be great. A picture that embodies excitement should show the athletes (and/or his teams) pure joy after scoring a goal or making a good shot. One of the most important aspects of being able to make a good picture great is to capture the emotion in the moment. In this section, you will find a selection of some of my favorite photographs featuring Priory athletes, each highlighting their pure joy in the sports they play. These images encapsulate the moments that mean so much to the athletes and the fans themselves.

      "While this image may not be one of my best, matter of fact, it isn't even of a Priory sporting event. However, I want to include this image on this website because it tells a story of a life that was taken way too early. Seen jumping into the arms of his teammate, number 72, Colin Brown - a Junior at CBC who plays as number 3 on their hockey team, but number 72 on his club team (pictured) the Affton Americans. While I did not know Colin, I came to the game excited to take pictures at a high-level club hockey game with Max Nadaud '26, who was injured and sat with me the entire game. He told me a lot about his team, but specifically about number 72, who they had nicknamed Brownie. Just a week later, Colin Brown was hit by a stray bullet while leaving one of his hockey games, and a few days later succumbed to his injuries. May Colin Brown rest in peace. ‚ù§Ô∏èü§çüíô/üíúüíõ",
