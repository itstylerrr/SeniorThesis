      "In a Priory Varsity Hockey game against Ladue on November 22nd, 2024, Freddy Gaertner '26 handles the puck through the Ladue defense. That is until he was tripped by a Ladue player who is out of frame. Even after being tripped, seemingly floating in the air, still has his eyes focused on moving forward. To capture this shot, I made sure my camera was shooting at a high shutter speed to freeze the action, specifically, it was at 1/800s!",
      "Quite possibly one of my favorite photos that I have ever taken depicts Nate Sutto '26, a goalie, has his eyes locked on to the falling puck in a puck-drop between Priory's number 76, JP Nadero '25, and Clayton's number 12. This picture was taken back on November 11, 2023, and even though I didn't study sports photography as I do now, I was able to capture one of the best shots of the year. What makes this picture so great from a technical perspective is most importantly the framing of the image. To make this picture great, I made sure that Nate was positioned in the middle of the frame (though the rule of thirds was not followed, I believe that it should be except in this particular photo) and in the foreground, blurred, are the two players going head to head.",
      "In a thriller of a game on February 24, 2024, the Priory Varsity Basketball team ended up winning their first district championship since 1956! In this game, the amount of determination, comradery, and pure grit was put on display. In this picture is one of the pivotal players on the team Robby Temprano '26, who was one of the point leaders on the team during this historic season, dribbles down the court while a Whitfield player is determined to stop him. While I wouldn't consider this picture great, I would consider it good. The good comes from the facial expressions that I have captured in this frame; however, this picture loses some points in my book because the right hand of the Whitfield player has been cut out of frame. In sports photography, you want to ensure that all limbs are in the picture.",

      "To me, a great shot that embodies determination in sports photography requires a diverse set of skills. Capturing an athlete's pure grit and perseverance involves getting up close to the action while remaining off the field, rink, or court. For this, I rely on my Sigma 60-600mm lens, which offers outstanding versatility in sports photography. This lens allows me to capture incredibly detailed close-up shots, showcasing the intensity and passion in an athlete's expression, while also giving me the ability to zoom out sufficiently to encompass the broader scene and all of the unfolding action. \n In this section, you will find a selection of some of my favorite photographs featuring Priory athletes, each highlighting their unwavering determination to win. These images encapsulate the moments that truly define dedication and hard work in sports. To dive deeper into the story behind each smaller image, simply click on the image itself for annotations and insights on what makes each shot unique and meaningful. I hope you enjoy viewing these moments as much as I enjoyed capturing them!",

      "Quite possibly one of my favorite categories to get a picture of is excitement. Immediately after checking my camera once an exciting moment happens in a game, I am very quickly able to tell if it will be great. A picture that embodies excitement should show the athletes (and/or his teams) pure joy after scoring a goal or making a good shot. One of the most important aspects of being able to make a good picture great is to capture the emotion in the moment. In this section, you will find a selection of some of my favorite photographs featuring Priory athletes, each highlighting their pure joy in the sports they play.
