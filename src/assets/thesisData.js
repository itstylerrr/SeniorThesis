      "In a Priory Varsity Hockey game against Ladue on November 22nd, 2024, Freddy Gaertner '26 handles the puck through the Ladue defense. That is until he was tripped by a Ladue player who is out of frame. Even after being tripped, seemingly floating in the air, still has his eyes focused on moving forward. To capture this shot, I made sure my camera was shooting at a high shutter speed to freeze the action, specifically, it was at 1/800s!",
      "Quite possibly one of my favorite photos that I have ever taken depicts Nate Sutto '26, a goalie, has his eyes locked on to the falling puck in a puck-drop between Priory's number 76, JP Nadero '25, and Clayton's number 12. This picture was taken back on November 11, 2023, and even though I didn't study sports photography as I do now, I was able to capture one of the best shots of the year. What makes this picture so great from a technical perspective is most importantly the framing of the image. To make this picture great, I made sure that Nate was positioned in the middle of the frame (though the rule of thirds was not followed, I believe that it should be except in this particular photo) and in the foreground, blurred, are the two players going head to head.",
      "In a thriller of a game on February 24, 2024, the Priory Varsity Basketball team ended up winning their first district championship since 1956! In this game, the amount of determination, comradery, and pure grit was put on display. In this picture is one of the pivotal players on the team Robby Temprano '26, who was one of the point leaders on the team during this historic season, dribbles down the court while a Whitfield player is determined to stop him. While I wouldn't consider this picture great, I would consider it good. The good comes from the facial expressions that I have captured in this frame; however, this picture loses some points in my book because the right hand of the Whitfield player has been cut out of frame. In sports photography, you want to ensure that all limbs are in the picture.",

      "To me, a great shot that embodies determination in sports photography requires a diverse set of skills. Capturing an athlete's pure grit and perseverance involves getting up close to the action while remaining off the field, rink, or court. For this, I rely on my Sigma 60-600mm lens, which offers outstanding versatility in sports photography. This lens allows me to capture incredibly detailed close-up shots, showcasing the intensity and passion in an athlete's expression, while also giving me the ability to zoom out sufficiently to encompass the broader scene and all of the unfolding action. \n In this section, you will find a selection of some of my favorite photographs featuring Priory athletes, each highlighting their unwavering determination to win. These images encapsulate the moments that truly define dedication and hard work in sports. To dive deeper into the story behind each smaller image, simply click on the image itself for annotations and insights on what makes each shot unique and meaningful. I hope you enjoy viewing these moments as much as I enjoyed capturing them!",

      "This photograph almost perfectly captures the essence of excitement in sports. Taken on November 25, 2024, during a Priory Varsity Hockey game against Fort Zumwalt West, Freddy Gaertner '26 leaps into the glass in celebration after scoring a pivotal goal. Surrounding him, Priory fans erupt in cheers, their energy and passion mirroring Gaertner's joy. To the left, teammate Auggie Werner '27 skates in, celebrating alongside him and adding a layer of camaraderie to the image. What makes this photo remarkable to me is the raw emotion from both the players and the most noticeable, the crowd. I ensured my camera settings were optimized to capture the high-intensity action—using a fast shutter speed of 1/800s to freeze Gaertner mid-air and highlight the dynamic interaction between the athlete and his ecstatic supporters.",
      "This shot captures Wynn O'Keefe '25 celebrating one of his first-ever varsity hockey goals in a game against Northwest on January 11, 2024. The mere excitement on Wynn’s face, with his glove raised high in victory, says it all. To his right, teammates Jack Lerits '25, Jake Waltz '25, and Cameron Robinson '25 stand near celebrating with him, their smiles beaming with pride and energy. What makes this picture stand out to me is the moment's purity—Wynn’s joy, supported by his teammates, tells a story of hard work and achievement. I used a fast shutter speed of 1/800s to ensure the players were sharply captured, freezing this perfect moment of celebration. The composition draws attention to Wynn as the focal point, but the inclusion of his teammates and the opposing goalie adds depth to the image, balancing the emotion on both sides of the play.",
      "Under the Friday night lights of September 8, 2023, Jack Parent '25 celebrates in pure adrenaline after scoring on a quarterback keeper in a game against Lutheran South. Front and center in the picture, Jack screams with raw emotion, flexing his forearms confidence, strength, and energy. The brighter backdrop of the night game makes the moment feel larger than life, with Jack acting as a silhouette.",

      "Quite possibly one of my favorite categories to get a picture of is excitement. Immediately after checking my camera once an exciting moment happens in a game, I am very quickly able to tell if it will be great. A picture that embodies excitement should show the athletes (and/or his teams) pure joy after scoring a goal or making a good shot. One of the most important aspects of being able to make a good picture great is to capture the emotion in the moment. In this section, you will find a selection of some of my favorite photographs featuring Priory athletes, each highlighting their pure joy in the sports they play. These images encapsulate the moments that mean so much to the athletes and the fans themselves.

      "In a thriller of a game on April 14, 2023, against CBC, the Ravens played an extremely close match, with each team trading goals back and forth. In this picture, Jack Parent '25 has just finished a dodge down the right alley and is passing the ball over to Mick Murphy '25, who is cutting toward him for a shot. The best technical aspect of this picture is how the ball is frozen mid-flight, showing the pass on its way to Mick. However, as this was only my second year of photography, I didn't quite understand many of the technical aspects of the craft. If I were to take this picture again, I would make sure that all the athletes' limbs are in frame or fully commit to an upper-body shot. Additionally, the rule of thirds is not being followed, so I would adjust the framing to improve the composition.",
      "In this picture, Liam Kallos '29 is dribbling down the field in the CYC Championship game. In the foreground is Caleb Albers '29, checking to the ball in an attempt to receive a pass to advance the play, which is why I chose this picture to represent the teamwork section. To capture this image, I was seated behind the goal that the Ravens were attacking on, by taking a low vantage point, I was able to capture a more level image, which overall makes the picture look better as you do not want to be shooting just at head level in sports photography. Another key factor that played into making this a good picture, was the lighting on the day. Despite this picture being taken on November 28th, 2024 it was still a nice warm day with plenty of sun. The abundance of sunlight helped me keep my shutter speed extremely high, while also keeping my ISO very low. These two things together allow me to capture a image that is frozen in time, while not being grainy. - Photo settings: ISO 900 360.0mm f/6 1/2000sec",
      "This might just be one of the best football pictures that I have taken.  On August 20th, 2024 the Priory Ravens Varsity football team played their first game of the season against Jefferson. Although the game ended in an unfortunate loss, I was able to capture some incredible pictures such as this one. To capture this picture, I was literally sprawled out on the ground shooting between the line judge's legs. I did this to capture the scene at the line right before the ball is snapped. I chose this image for the teamwork section because the offensive line on a football team is the most essential part of the team. Without the O-Line, nothing else would be able to work as the quarterback would be immediately sacked. The technical aspects that were able to make this picture great in my opinion are a combination of the angle I took the shot at (which was aforementioned) along with the very sunny August day which allowed me to have a great shutter speed with a low ISO. If I were to change one thing about this picture, I would have liked to shoot more from the side so I could attempt to capture the emotion in the offensive lines eyes, I believe if I was able to do that, the picture would be perfect. - Photo Settings: ISO 320 280mm f/5.6 1/1000sec",

      "To have a great team, you can't just have great players; you need strong team chemistry as well. Capturing these moments is incredibly meaningful to both myself and the players alike. In this picture, we see Max Nadaud '26 skating over to the ecstatic fans in celebration of a game-winning goal on December 1, 2023, against MICDS. Following Max are all his teammates on the ice at the time, each of whom contributed in their own way to assisting him in scoring the goal.",

      "After I rolled my ankle the day before, I asked my coach if it would be alright if I could take pictures during the game as the trainer said I was unable to play in order to let my injury heal. After he agreed, I was extremely happy as I have never gotten to take soccer pictures for a team that I play on! I also have never really taken soccer photography besides some work I did at STL SC for a article. Around the start of the game, the sun was still out, and providing a significant amount of light allowing for really nice pictures; however, near the end of the game the sun went down VERY fast and I had to make quick adjustments to allow the photos to turn out well. After the game concluded and the Priory Ravens ended up winning, the team walked over to the fans who stayed and supported the team throughout the game. To capture this moment of victory, I turned down my shutter speed to allow the ISO to go lower and create a less grainy picture. I was able to lower my shutter speed as the athletes were not moving fast, but rather just walking over to the fans. - Camera Settings: ISO 4500 60mm f/4.5 1/640sec",
      "As I mentioned in the introduction to this section, I have created a tradition with the Varsity Hockey team. After every game we win, I hop on the ice and round up some people to take a picture holding their hands in a W. I could provide many pictures of this post game tradition, but I chose this one because Freddy Gaertner '26 is laying on the ground along with Thomas Kraeger '26 the team manager crouching down, making for a more balanced picture. After the game concludes, I switch to my Sigma 24-70 f/2.8 lens to get a really low f-stop which allows for a low ISO. I  chose this picture because it was taking after the conclusion of the Priory vs. Ladue game on December 27th, 2024 where the Ravens gave the Rams their first lost in the central division. - Camera Settings: ISO 800 30mm f/2.8 1/800sec",
      "On November 18th, 2024 the Priory Ravens took down the Westminster Wildcats in a not-so-close game, but none-the-less it was still a rivalry game. In the final minutes, the Wildcats ended up pulling their goalie in an attempt to score a goal or two. However, their attack fizzled out, and the Ravens got possession of the puck back. The puck was passed to Freddy Gaertner '26 on the right side of the ice, who launches it down towards the open goal of the Westminster Wildcats. As the puck sails past the goal line, the referee blows his whistle, and Freddy celebrates to the ecstatic crowd. What makes this picture so good, is the referee in the foreground doing the hand motion for a goal being scored. And in focus, is Freddy celebrating with the fans. - Camera Settings: ISO 2500 105mm f/5.4 1/800sec",

      "Ah yes, victory! Every athletes favorite part of the sport. Along with this, it is one of my favorite categories to capture. This is because the attitude in the venue just is overwhelmed with excitement, pride, and joy. To capture this, I have created with a tradition with the hockey team this year where after every win, I hop on the ice and capture a picture of the team holding up a 'W' with their hands.

      "While this image may not be one of my best, matter of fact, it isn't even of a Priory sporting event. However, I want to include this image on this website because it tells a story of a life that was taken way too early. Seen jumping into the arms of his teammate, number 72, Colin Brown - a Junior at CBC who plays as number 3 on their hockey team, but number 72 on his club team (pictured) the Affton Americans. While I did not know Colin, I came to the game excited to take pictures at a high-level club hockey game with Max Nadaud '26, who was injured and sat with me the entire game. He told me a lot about his team, but specifically about number 72, who they had nicknamed Brownie. Just a week later, Colin Brown was hit by a stray bullet while leaving one of his hockey games, and a few days later succumbed to his injuries. May Colin Brown rest in peace. ❤️🤍💙/💜💛",

      "Every team needs a great leader, or just great leadership in general. While I may not have the most pictures of this section I believe that it will add something special to my thesis. To capture these images of leadership I use a combination of both my Sigma 60-600mm and my Sigma 24-70mm lenses. Through the use of these lenses, I can choose between really close up sports shots with the 60-600. Or really sharp pictures with great bokeh with the 24-70mm f/2.8 lense. In this section, you will find a selection of some of my favorite photographs featuring the leaders throught Priory athletics, each of which depicting just how much the leaders of these teams want the team as a whole to improve. I hope that these images can showcase what it means to be a great leader in high school sports.
