# Tyler Witkowski - Senior Thesis

## Overview
Welcome to the repository for my senior thesis project, "Capturing Emotion in Photography." This project is a culmination of my passion for photography and my experiences as a student at Saint Louis Priory School.

## About Me
I am Tyler Witkowski, a senior at Saint Louis Priory School and an avid photographer. Since my freshman year, I have been dedicated to capturing the spirit and excitement of our school's sporting events, from Junior School Football to Varsity Lacrosse. Photography is not just a hobby for me; it is a passion that I hope to continue pursuing in college while working towards a degree in business and computer science.

## Significance of the Thesis
This thesis is extremely important to me as it represents the intersection of my love for photography and my academic journey. Through this project, I aim to showcase the emotions and stories behind each moment I capture, highlighting the power of visual storytelling. It is my hope that this work will inspire others and demonstrate the profound impact that photography can have in preserving memories and conveying emotions.
